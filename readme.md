## expo component preview preview

This project is to demo the expo component preview VSCode extension

Install the extension:

```
Name: Expo Component Preview
Id: andydevs123.expo-component-preview
Description: Instantly preview React Native components
Version: 0.0.1
Publisher: andydevs123
VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andydevs123.expo-component-preview
```

And checkout MyComponents.tsx to preview components

**Note**: 

Previewing components in the same file as the `ExpoComponentPreview` wrapper causes some require cycles and unpredictable behaviour!
